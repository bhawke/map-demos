## map demo 13
Demonstrates controlling layers through as cascading menus.

Notes:
* All custom code, couldn't find a plugin that did this.  Started with the the following mapbox example:
  https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/layers/
* Future improvements could be to drive the entire menu system from a model, started moving in that direction after
  initial proof. Also could use some better default styling.
* Initially started out extending the current layer control and creating new plugin but dropped due to time constraints.

#### third party dependencies
* leaflet
* jquery
* modernizr
* fontawesome (could do without but made for nice checkbox and radio images in menu lists)

#### working in browsers
* ie8
* firefox 24
* chrome 38
