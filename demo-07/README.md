## map demo 07
Map that demonstrates heatmap functionality using markerclusterer.

Research on all heatmap plugins revealed that all are using html5/css3 features such as canvas.  All of these
require ie9 or greater.  The markerclusterer delivers similar results in that the user can get an idea
of where the data is before zooming in for more detail.

The following were plugins found for leaflet heatmaps (Note - none worked in ie8 tests) :
* https://github.com/sunng87/heatcanvas
* http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/example-heatmap-leaflet.html
* https://github.com/dpiccone/leaflet-div-heatmap
* http://ursudio.com/webgl-heatmap-leaflet/

#### third party dependencies
* leaflet
* jquery

#### working in browsers
* ie8
* firefox 24
* chrome 38
