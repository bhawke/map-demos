## map demo 08
ESRI Feature layer (Portland Parks) with popup info window.

Notes:
* There was some question whether feature popup's required custom coding under leaflet.  This demonstrates that there is built in functionality, at least for esri feature, will attempt the same in demo 09 using wms layer.
* I monitored the network as I panned/zoomed and it looks like the features are dynamic and only loaded on demand.

#### third party dependencies
* leaflet
* jquery
* esri-leaflet

#### working in browsers
